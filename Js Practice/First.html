            What is Lorem Ipsum?
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>
 Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br>
  when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type <br>
  specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into<br>
   electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in <br>
   the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,<br>
    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br>

Why do we use it?<br>
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable <br>
content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is <br>
that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using <br>
'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop<br>
 publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default <br>
 model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in<br>
  their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,<br> 
  sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).<br>
